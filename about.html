                    Anthony is a double major in Computer Science and Finance with a minor in Mathematics. 
                    His intersts lie within the finanical domain and the application of science and technology to the space.
                    He currently works as an intern at a proprietary trading firm where he develops full-stack applications for equity options traders.

                    This website came to fruition from Anthony's experience developing financial dashboards for the firm he currently works for. 
                    Originally the plan was to plot volatility surfaces with volatility data points, however most of that work seemed to be back-end work, and since this is a class about web-development, it seemed a bit off topic.

                    <br>
                    We did some research on different charting libraries and found a cool way to integrate TradingView Widgets into the website. 
                    After doing this, we came to the discovery that we needed to develop a better overall design and template that actually looked good and didn't rely on the TradingView widget's for aesthetics. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Along the way, we added some candy to the page, but this is the end product. Hopefully you find it as cool as we do.
