                    Welcome to a little description about us and this project.  <br> Thank you to <a href="https://www.luc.edu/cs/people/ftfaculty/haywardnicholas.shtml">Professor Hayward</a> for teaching us some cool things.
                    <br> Below is a description about us, our interests, and the website.

                    Anthony is a double major in Computer Science and Finance with a minor in Mathematics.
                    His interests lie within the finanical domain and the application of science and technology to the space.

                    This website came to fruition from Anthony's experience developing financial dashboards for the firm he currently works for.
                    Originally the plan was to plot volatility surfaces with volatility data points, most of which seemed to be back-end work, and since this is a class about front end web-development, it seemed a bit off topic.
                    <br><br>
                    We did some research on different charting libraries and found a cool way to integrate TradingView Widgets into the website.
                    After doing this, we came to the discovery that we needed to develop a better overall design and template that actually looked good and didn't rely on the TradingView widget's for aesthetics.
                    <br><br>
                    Along the way, we added some candy to the page, but this is the end product. Hopefully you find it as cool as we do.
